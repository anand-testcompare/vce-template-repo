# Gemini Project Configuration

## Project Goals

This is a template repository for new projects. The goal is to have a solid foundation for development with AI tools, with a focus on:

- **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, easy-to-understand code.
- **Modern Standards:** Use well-established, popular frameworks and libraries that are well-suited for LLM-based development.
- **Up-to-date:** Reference the latest versions of documentation and tools.
- **IDE Agnostic:** Be able to move seamlessly between different IDEs.

## Development Guidelines

- All actions should be reversible/undoable.
- Use the tools available to you to automate as much as possible.
- Keep the codebase clean and well-documented.
