# Vibe Coded Excellence (VCE) üöÄ

_Because scrolling through command history and pressing enter is hard work_

## What's This About?

Look, AI coding is everywhere now. Some people are freaking out about it, others are pretending it doesn't exist. I'm just trying to make it not suck.

The real problem isn't that AI writes bad code - it's that AI makes it **really easy to scale bad habits**. You know what I'm talking about:

- That commit message that says "fix" with 47 changed files
- The React component that somehow needs 15 dependencies
- The function that's 200 lines long because "it works"
- The database query that would make your DBA cry

**The thing is**, we now have this weird opportunity where we can literally teach the robots our hard-learned lessons. Instead of everyone having to live through their own production disasters to learn best practices, we can just... encode that wisdom upfront.

## My Origin Story (aka Why I Built This)

Honestly? I got tired of typing detailed commit messages.

I'd finish some work, go to commit, and then face that moment of "ugh, I should write a proper commit message with context and reasoning..." vs "screw it, `git commit -m 'fixed stuff'`"

Too often, laziness won. Then six months later I'd be staring at git history like "WHAT DID PAST ME EVEN DO HERE??"

So I built a prompt that lets me type a couple tabs, walk away, come back to a perfectly formatted commit with proper context and clear rollback points. No more 1000-line commits with the message "updates."

That's when it clicked - what if all the shortcuts made the **good practice** easier than the bad practice?

## The Vibe

This isn't about being the code police or building some enterprise framework. It's about:

- **Lazy optimization**: Making good practices the path of least resistance
- **Battle-tested shortcuts**: Prompts that encode lessons from production disasters
- **Anti-overthinking**: Simple solutions that actually work at scale
- **Real talk**: Examples from actual projects, not theoretical BS
- **Quick setup**: For when you're flipping to new PCs, running from servers, etc.

## What's In Here

This is mostly shortcuts and little scripts that I ended up going back-and-forth with Claude or Gemini to get right. You know the drill - you start with some vague prompt, get 80% of what you want, then spend 20 minutes refining it until it actually works.

At the end of those sessions, I'd ask: "Hey, if you had just one shot to generate this perfectly, what would that prompt be?"

That's what these markdown files are. Think of it as micro reinforcement learning or prompt distillation - taking all that trial and error and boiling it down to the one-shot version that actually works.

**Note**: I've tried a handful of AI IDEs, but I'm 90% Claude CLI or Gemini right now, so those will be updated way more often. This is just my starting point when setting up new environments.

## Quick Start

### Installing Claude Commands

```bash
# Copy specific command to Claude CLI
cp claude-commands/company_high_impact_research.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Or copy all commands (because using the down arrow is hard work)
cp claude-commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Research a company for demo data
claude company_high_impact_research "JNJ biologics"

# Auto-test a web application
claude explore_web_app_using_playwright "http://localhost:3000"

# Debug GitHub Actions
claude github-actions-debug-workflow

# Create PR from current changes
claude git-branch-and-create-pr
```

## Summary from my rant at chatgpt

I've found myself having a lot fewer opinions, but a lot stronger ones. e.g., I hated sonnet for a long time now I am happily slapping $200 on their desk every month. I used to fiend about every new release/feature from langchain/langgraph and now I have zero desire to add more black box crap ontop of black boxes and even if that code base is stable now (I doub't it), I'm not touching that shit for anything that isn't a just for fun type project.


## Contributing

Got a prompt that saves you time? Throw it in here.
If you're a jaded sr. dev and want to talk shit about what softwware dev willl look like in a few years, hmu. I miss those discussions
Want to fork this and build something completely different? Go for it. No attribution needed.
Feel compelled to take over ownership, cool I'll transfer it (assuming you actually know what you're doing)
This is just me putting my thoughts somewhere public instead of keeping them in random text files in Obsidiamn. If it helps someone else avoid a production fire, cool. If not, at least I have a backup of my prompts now.
